# This is a first project of Udacity's data scientist nanodegree program. 
In this project I have chosen the Airbnb dataset of Tokyo city. <br />
I have addressed the following three business questions. <br />
1. What are the top 5 expensive and inexpensive neighborhoods in Tokyo? 
2. What are the types of properties available in top 5 expensive and inexpensive neighborhoods of Tokyo? 
3. What are the average price of different types of properties in the top 5 expensive and inexpensive neighborhood of Tokyo?

As part of study I have predicted the prices of neighborhoods considering a few features.
You can read the my medium blog post and detailed analysis of result here.
